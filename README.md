The main class is the Game class. It creates the Board and the GameEngine instances and also the InputHandler(single or two player).
The GameEngine basically just refreshes the screen to get about 60fps.
The Board takes care of drawing the ball and the paddles while the ball and paddles take care of their own movements.
